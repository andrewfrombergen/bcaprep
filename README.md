The public magnet high school I went to, Bergen County Academies, has a crazy admissions process with a 15% acceptance rate that mirrors the college admissions
process: essays, transcripts, recommendations, interviews, and more. For-profit companies* offering expensive preparation courses have stepped in to prepare
students that can afford it, but a fair shot is out of reach for lower-income students. This might help explain why BCA's student body is disproportionately
white and Asian (38% white, 51% Asian) as well as wealthy (only 5% free or reduced lunch).**

BCA Prep is a web app that serves as a free and comprehensive resource for all students applying to BCA. For both sections of the entrance test (English and
math), there is advice and a list of resources that I recommend for preparation, and there is login functionality which allows applicants to plan and track their
progress with a study plan that saves between sessions. The site also contains my tips for the other parts of the application: essays, teacher recommendations,
and the interview. It has frequently asked questions and answers to those questions, as well as directions for contacting me if there are questions that are not
yet covered.

The app was built with a Flask framework incorporating Python, SQL, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. My hope is that this app would help equalize the resources that
disadvantaged BCA applicants have compared to their wealthier peers and (ultimately) help make BCA a more racially and socioeconomically diverse place.

Acknowledgements: Steven DiSilvio, my friend and fellow BCA graduate, gave me the idea for this project. I credit CS50 instructors David Malan, Brian Yu, and Yoel
Hawa for teaching me the skills to make this app, Helen Cho for being a very supportive friend in the publication process, and the finance problem set in CS50 for
being a starting point in many aspects. I used favicon.io (https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) to make the favicon.ico file.
